# Markov-Model
Build a text based speech recognition program that utilizes a k-order Markov learning model 

# hashtable.py
Contaisn a linear-probing hashtable with logical deletion of non-existant keys

# markov.py
class that when given a string of text from an unidentified speaker utilizes a Markov model for a known speaker to assess the likelihood that the text was uttered by that speaker.

# benchmarking the hash table
below shows the performance of the hash table versus the built in python dictionary
